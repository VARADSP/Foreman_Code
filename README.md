>    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, x86_64
>    Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), i386/amd64/armhf/aarch64

- Considering Centos 7 For Installation Of Foreman on localhost machine

- Using a recent version of Puppet is recommended, which is available from the Puppet Labs repository. To use Puppet 5.x with Puppet Agent and Puppet Server: 


```shell
 $ sudo yum -y install https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppet5/puppet5-release-el-7.noarch.rpm
```

- Enable the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) and the Foreman repos:


```shell
$ sudo yum -y install http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
```


```shell
$ sudo yum -y install https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.17/el7/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm
```

- Downloading the installer

```shell
$ sudo yum -y install foreman-installer
```

- Running the installer
  
```shell
 $  sudo foreman-installer
```

- After it completes, the installer will print some details about where to find Foreman and the Smart Proxy and Puppet master if they were installed along Foreman. Output should be similar to this:

   * Foreman is running at https://theforeman.example.com
      Initial credentials are admin / 3ekw5xtyXCoXxS29
  * Foreman Proxy is running at https://theforeman.example.com:8443
  * Puppetmaster is running at port 8140
  The full log is at /var/log/foreman-installer/foreman-installer.log
